## Entity: Package

A `Package Entity` is a Node.js package, which usually contains a `package.json` file to indicate this, and its name can
be used as an import specifier (not directly available in environments other than `node.js`).   


> Please note the difference between a ECMAScript `Module` and a Node.js `Package`. Both them can be imported, but
> a `Module` may only refer to a single ECMAScript source file (which is covered in `File Entity`); and a `Package` is
> more complicated since it can contain multiple directories and files, properties of a `Package` is defined in
> corresponding `package.json` file, and `Package` can be nested.

For ArkTS: A `Package Entity` is a structure just like 'JS/TS' package, which contains a `oh-package.json5` file to indicate
this.This is **different** from `Module Entity`.

### Supported Patterns

```yaml
name: Package declaration
freeForm: true
```

#### Semantic: Single Package

Typically, every `node.js` project contains at least one `package.json` file. With that file presents, a `node.js`
package is then defined. The directory structure can be described as the following graph.

```text
PackageName
|-- node_modules (Should not be version controlled)
|-- src
|-- ...
`-- package.json
```

Properties in `package.json` define much useful information, such as name, version, type(determines whether the module
systems should follow rules of Commonjs or ESModule), dependencies, and etc..

##### How `package.json` affects the results

Some properties may have impact on the static analysis process, which are listed below.

###### `name` field

`name` specifies the name of the package, which can be used in import specifiers.

* Regular name

  Regular name can be composed by any alphabet characters, numbers, and may contain hyphens and underscores.
  E.g.: `foo`, `bar2`, `some-pacakge`.

* Scoped name

  Package name can be prefixed with the scope `@xxx/`, while installing packages with the same scope, they will be
  located under `node_modules/@xxx/`. E.g.: `@ArkInsight/core`, `@ArkInsight/cli`.

###### `type` field

`type` specifies the module format that `node.js` uses for all `.js` files that have that package.json file as their
nearest parent.

###### `files` field

> Default: * (All files)

`files` specifies the entries to be included when the package is installed as a dependency.

###### `main` field

> Default: `index.js` in the package's root folder

`main` specifies the entry point of the package, that is, the file when the import specifier contains only the package
name being referenced.

###### `exports` field

`exports` is an alternative to the "main" that can support defining sub-path exports and conditional exports while
encapsulating internal un-exported modules.

###### `imports` field

`imports` specifies mappings from shorted specifiers starting with `#` to qualified import specifiers, this also allows
conditional imports.

###### `browser` field

This is equivalent to `main`, only to hint that the package is meant to be used client-side, where some global objects (
such as `window`) are not available in `node.js` environment.

#### Semantic: Nested Package

Packages can be nested, which supports the concept of [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). That's saying
the **scope** of a package starts from the same directory containing its `package.json`, and ends to all subdirectories
until another `package.json` is found, or reaching a directory named `node_modules`, or reaching the end of the
sub-...-sub-directories. The directory structure can be described as the following graph.

```text
ParentPackage
|-- ...
|-- packages
|   |-- ChildPackage_0
|   |   |-- ...
|   |   `-- package.json
|   |-- ChildPackage_1
|   |   |-- ...
|   |   `-- package.json
`-- package.json (Top-level package)
```

##### How nesting affects the results

Some properties may have impact on the static analysis process, which are listed below.

###### `workspace` field

`workspace` specifies subpackages that form a monorepo which enables `npm` to manage multiple packages from the local
files system from within a singular top-level, root package.

#### Semantic: Single ArkTS Package

Typically, every `ArkTS` project contains at least one `oh-package.json5` file. With that file presents, a `ArkTS`
package is then defined. The directory structure can be described as the following graph.

```text
PackageName
|-- oh_modules (Should not be version controlled)
|-- entry
    |-- src
    |-- ...
    `-- oh-package.json5
|-- ...
`-- oh-package.json5
```

Properties in `oh-package.json5` define much useful information, such as name, version, dependencies, devDependencies, etc..

##### How `oh-package.json5` affects the results

Some properties may have impact on the static analysis process, which are listed below.

###### `name` field

`name` specifies the name of the package, which can be used in import specifiers.

* Regular name

  Regular name can be composed by any alphabet characters, numbers, and may contain hyphens and underscores.
  E.g.: `foo`, `bar2`, `some-pacakge`.

* Scoped name

  Package name can be prefixed with the scope `@xxx/`, while installing packages with the same scope, they will be
  located under `oh_modules/@xxx/`. E.g.: `@ArkInsight/core`, `@ArkInsight/cli`.
